## The Art of Design: Software & Experimental Design

Analysing data is unimaginable without a statistical software. Anyone who requires statistical computing on a regular basis would frequently interact with a statistical software and therefore the interface design can have a radical effect on the masses. In this talk, I will dive into a range of programming paradigms with relation to the interface design of software. I will then discuss in-depth about a novel computational framework, called the "grammar of experimental design", and its implementation as the edibble R-package. 

### Biography

Dr. Emi Tanaka is a lecturer in statistics at Monash University whose primary interest is to develop impactful statistical methods and tools that can readily be used by practitioners. Her research area include data visualisation, mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She is currently the President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victorian Branch and is an avid programmer in R, HTML/CSS and other computational languages.
